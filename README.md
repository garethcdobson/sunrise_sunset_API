## Sennen Tech Code Task
### Brief

Write a small example in Typescript (Javascript also acceptable) / nodejs.  

There is no right or wrong answer here and do as much or as little as you like -just wanting to get a feel for coding style and ability.  Think clean, tidy, well-structured code over features / functionality.  Good naming is also a bonus. Structure and arrange as you wish.  

Basic example:
* Using https://sunrise-sunset.org/api, fetch the sunrise / sunset times
* Generate a list of 100 random lat / long points around the world
* Run 5 requests in parrallel, run next 5 after 5 second break if they've all finished
* Find earliest sunrise and list the day length for this time

Bonus points: 
* Use ramda, implement some functional programming
* Use ES6/7 array features
* Handle errors properly
* Additional functionality
* Unit tests
